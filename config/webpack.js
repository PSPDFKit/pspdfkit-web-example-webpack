 * The production version is built in the `./dist` folder. When building the
 * development mode it also starts a web server at http://localhost:8080
 *
 * This configuration file creates two main bundles:
 *
 * - vendor.js - contains external libraries (including nutrient-viewer.js).
 * - app.js - contains the application code.
 *
 * It also copies the WASM/ASM and CSS files from the npm package folder, since
 * `PSPDFKit.load` loads them relative to the application execution path.
